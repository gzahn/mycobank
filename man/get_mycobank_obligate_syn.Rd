\title{Get the obligate synonyms from Mycobank for a vector of taxa names}
\usage{
get_mycobank_obligate_syn(taxa, mycobank_db)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa}{Character. Vector of taxa names to look up.}

\item{mycobank_db}{Data frame. Object name for Mycobank database. Typically created by get_mycobank_db()}
}
\value{
Character vector. This returns a vector of the "obligate_synonym" for your query taxa.
}
\description{
Parses through the Mycobank synonyms and taxon names to pull the taxon obligate synonym for a vector of query taxon names
Names should be in a character vector and in the format "genus species" or just "genus" (variants and strains accepted)
If a given taxonomic name query consists of only one 'word' then taxonomic level of 'genus' is assumed
}
\details{
This is a shortcut function that makes use of get_mycobank_synonyms() to just pull the "obligate_synonym".
}
\examples{
db <- get_mycobank_db(overwrite = FALSE)
taxa <- c("Abaphospora borealis","Conisphaeria borealis var. minor","Sphaeria borealis","Nonsense name","Abaphospora")
get_mycobank_obligate_syn(taxa,db)
